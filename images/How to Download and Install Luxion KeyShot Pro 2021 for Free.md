To assign materials to your model, you can either drag and drop them from the Library panel or use the Material tab in the Project panel. You can choose from hundreds of preset materials such as metals, plastics, fabrics, glass, wood, and more. You can also edit the properties of the materials such as color, texture, roughness, transparency, and more. You can also create your own custom materials using the Material Graph.
